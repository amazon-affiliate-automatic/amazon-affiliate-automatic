# FTC Disclosure Guidelines for Amazon Affiliates

## Essential Legal Requirements for Affiliate Marketing

### Understanding FTC Disclosure Requirements

The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) requires clear and conspicuous disclosure of all material connections between advertisers and endorsers. For Amazon affiliates, this means you must disclose your affiliate relationship whenever you promote products or include affiliate links.

#### Why Disclosures Matter
- **Legal Compliance**: Required by federal law
- **Consumer Protection**: Helps consumers make informed decisions
- **Trust Building**: Transparency builds audience trust
- **Platform Compliance**: Required by Amazon Associates program
- **Penalty Avoidance**: Prevents FTC fines and account termination

### FTC Disclosure Standards

#### The "Clear and Conspicuous" Standard

**Clear Requirements**:
- Use plain, understandable language
- Avoid technical jargon or confusing terms
- Make disclosures in the same language as your content
- Ensure disclosures are easily readable

**Conspicuous Requirements**:
- Place disclosures where consumers will notice them
- Use adequate font size and contrasting colors
- Position disclosures before affiliate links when possible
- Don't hide disclosures in fine print or footers

#### Proximity Requirements
- **Close to Claims**: Place disclosures near affiliate links and product recommendations
- **Before Action**: Disclose before consumers click affiliate links
- **Repeated Disclosures**: Include on every page with affiliate content
- **Platform-Specific**: Adapt for different platforms and formats

### Acceptable Disclosure Language

#### Recommended Disclosure Statements

**Standard Amazon Associates Disclosure**:
```
"As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases."
```

**Alternative Acceptable Disclosures**:
```
"This post contains affiliate links. If you click and make a purchase, 
I may receive a commission at no extra cost to you."

"I participate in the Amazon Services LLC Associates Program, an affiliate 
advertising program designed to provide a means for sites to earn advertising 
fees by advertising and linking to Amazon.com."

"Some links in this post are affiliate links, which means I may earn a 
commission if you make a purchase through them."
```

**Enhanced Transparency Disclosures**:
```
"Full disclosure: This post contains affiliate links, meaning I may earn 
a small commission if you make a purchase through these links. This helps 
support my content creation at no additional cost to you. I only recommend 
products I genuinely believe in."
```

#### Unacceptable Disclosure Examples

**Too Vague**:
- "This post contains links"
- "Some links may be compensated"
- "I may receive compensation"

**Too Hidden**:
- Disclosures only in website footer
- Tiny font or low contrast text
- Disclosures after affiliate links

**Too Technical**:
- Complex legal language
- Industry jargon
- Confusing terminology

### Platform-Specific Disclosure Requirements

#### Blog Posts and Websites

**Placement Guidelines**:
- **Top of Post**: Include disclosure at the beginning of content
- **Before First Link**: Disclose before the first affiliate link appears
- **Sidebar Widgets**: Prominent placement in visible areas
- **About Page**: Include general affiliate disclosure

**Implementation Example**:
```html
<div class="affiliate-disclosure" style="background: #f0f0f0; padding: 15px; margin: 20px 0; border-left: 4px solid #007cba;">
    <strong>Affiliate Disclosure:</strong> As an Amazon Associate, I earn from qualifying purchases. This helps support my content at no extra cost to you.
</div>
```

#### Social Media Platforms

    affiliateLinks.forEach(link => {
        if (!link.previousElementSibling?.classList.contains('disclosure')) {
            const disclosure = document.createElement('div');
            disclosure.className = 'affiliate-disclosure';
            disclosure.innerHTML = '<small><em>Affiliate link - I may earn a commission</em></small>';
            link.parentNode.insertBefore(disclosure, link);
        }
    });
}
```

#### Contextual Disclosures

**Product-Specific Disclosures**:
```
